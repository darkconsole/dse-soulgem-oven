# Features New To SGO4

* Add support for new races without editing SGO4.

* Translatable into other languages.

* Uses BodySlide / Racemenu Morphs for better shaped scaling.

* Settings are saved to an external JSON file so you do not have to set them
  all every time you start a new save.

* Followers will sync their fertility cycles if they are following you
  long enough.



# Translating

There are two files that must be edited to translate. First would be the normal
UI translation files you can find in `interface\translations` and it should be
translated the same way as any other SkyUI based mod.

The other file is found in `configs\translations` - copy English.json and edit
its contents.

Get me these two edited files one way or another.



# Mod API

Not modding in the true sense, given that you can just mod this mod and be done.
Rather, this API allows you to do things like create an armour enchant that
modifies things like gem growth speed, stuff like that.
