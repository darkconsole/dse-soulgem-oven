## Soulgem Oven 4: Special Edition Edition
--------

This is extremely a work in progress do not install this. Your game will probably literally explode. Broken shards of soulgem coming at you at high velocity are sharper than Mehrunes' Razor you have been warned.

### About

If you've used previous Soulgem Oven's you already know what is going on. This version is for Special Edition, uses BodySlide morphs instead of bone scales, and unfortunately for you not backwards compatible with Oldrim.

### Requirements

Version requirements are much stricter this time, due to SSE modding still being a work in progress these minimum version numbers are not suggestions, things will not work if you do dumb.
